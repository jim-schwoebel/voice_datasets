WHAMR! is an extension to WHAM! that adds artificial reverberation to the speech signals in addition to the background noise. The noise audio was collected at various urban locations throughout the San Francisco Bay Area in late 2018. The environments primarily consist of restaurants, cafes, bars, and parks. Size of WHAM! dataset: 17.65 GB unzipping to 35 GB.
* [Zero Resource Speech Challenge](https://github.com/bootphon/zerospeech2017) - The ultimate goal of the Zero Resource Speech Challenge is to construct a system that learns an end-to-end Spoken Dialog (SD) system, in an unknown language, from scratch, using only information available to a language learning infant. “Zero resource” refers to zero linguistic expertise (e.g., orthographic/linguistic transcriptions), not zero information besides audio (visual, limited human feedback, etc). The fact that 4-year-olds spontaneously learn a language without supervision from language experts show that this goal is theoretically reachable.
